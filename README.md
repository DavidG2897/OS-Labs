# Operating Systems Class
All code for my Operating Systems class is in this repo.

# How to build and run
All code in here is programmed in C, preferably use GCC compiler to build.

  From terminal (UNIX) use the following command to build:
  > gcc <input_file> -o <output_filename>
    Ex. user> gcc helloWorld.c -o helloWorld.o //Compiles file helloWorld.c and outputs the executable helloWorld.o
  From terminal/cmd use the folowing command to run:
  > ./<output_filename>
    Ex. user> ./helloWorld.o
        user> "Hello World!"
