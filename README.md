# Performance summary conclusion
  # Challenge 1 (ch1.c)
    Since this code is running on a large computer and it is a fairly simple code there is no present problems with CPU performance, nevertheless execution time could be improved. O(n^2) time complexity.
    No memory issues, only using small 8bit variables (unsigned chars).
  # Challenge 2 (ch2.c)
    This code requires user input, so execution time could take as long as the user likes. It uses an insertion sort algorithm so O(n^2) time complexity as worst-case scenario.
    No memory issues, although it uses a dynamic array structure.
  # Challenge 3 (ch3.c)
